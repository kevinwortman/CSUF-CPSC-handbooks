Exams
The student has no right to the return of written work resulting from a test or examination. However, the student does have a right to examine and discuss tests and examinations with the faculty member involved, and at the option of the faculty member, these materials may be returned to the student. Examinations not returned to students shall be retained on file for one semester after the last day of the semester in which the course was taken except when they become part of an academic appeal in which case they shall be retained until the appeal has been concluded.

Research & Creative Activity (Homework)
It is the student's responsibility to request the return of products of research and creative activity. Where such products have been submitted for evaluation in fulfillment or partial fulfillment for a course, program, degree or other certification and where the student does not request the return of such products within one semester after the student's final course grades are assigned or after the date of the awarding of a degree or other certification, the faculty has no further obligation to retain such materials.
