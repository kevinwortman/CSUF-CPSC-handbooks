\chapter{Office Hours}
In a nutshell, you should hold a minimum of 3 hours of office hours per week. The office hours are typically held in your office but can be held elsewhere. The time and place of the office hours must be posted. A good faith effort must be made to meet your students during office hours and to make any reasonable accommodation for students who cannot.

UPS 230.02 covers faculty office hours. A link to the document is <http://www.fullerton.edu/senate/documents/UPS230.020_Office%20Hours_effec%205-11-12.pdf>.

2015 CSU New Department Chairs Workshop
Friday, October 16
CSU Long Beach Campus
 
The 19th annual CSU New Department Chairs Workshop will be on Friday, October 16, at the CSU Long Beach campus. This is the Friday following the Fall HRO/AVP meetings on October 12-14.  For those of you who are new to your positions, this workshop is targeted to new chairs (newer chairs who didnâ€™t get a chance to attend in their first year are welcome).  We always have sessions featuring experienced chairs sharing their advice and wisdom as well as a session on hot issues from the CBA and additional topics that rotate from year to year.  (We are always on the lookout for suggestions for chairs who would be good presenters as well as topics to include!) We charge the campus a modest fee to cover costs.
