\chapter{Introduction}

\section{The Field of Computer Science}
Computer Science is the systematic study of computing systems and
computation. The body of knowledge contains the theoretical foundation
for understanding computing systems and methods, design methodology,
algorithms, and software and hardware tools.

These programs cover a wide range of areas, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item multimedia and digital game technologies,
\item Internet and enterprise computing,
\item wireless and mobile computing,
\item databases and data mining,
\item computer security,
\item software engineering, and
\item computational bioinformatics.
\end{itemize}

Computer Science prepares graduates for rewarding careers in all areas
of business, government, education and industry. These organizations,
large and small, need computer professionals to address their needs
with specific programs and systems. Computer science professionals
tackle complicated problems and create computer solutions to solve
them, devising new ways to use computers.

\section{The Department}
\label{section:the_department}
The faculty and staff of the Computer Science Department welcome you
into our program and sincerely wish you good luck on your journey into

\section{The Programs}

The Department offers the following Undergraduate programs, which are
documented in this Handbook:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (B.S. CS), and
\item Minor in Computer Science.
\end{enumerate}

The Department also offers Graduate programs, which are documented elsewhere:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Master of Science in Computer Science (M.S. CS),
\item Master of Science in Software Engineering (M.S.E.), and
\item Accelerated Master of Science in Software Engineering (A.M.S.E.).
\end{enumerate}

CS courses are also components of Computer Engineering, Electrical
Engineering, and Mathematics programs at \CampusName.

\section{Objectives and Outcomes}
\index{Program Educational Objectives (PEOs)} \index{Program Outcomes}
The Program Educational Objectives and Program Outcomes for the CS
B.S. are documented in the University Catalog at \shrunkurl{major}.

\section{Using This Document}

This handbook covers information on how to complete a B.S. or a Minor
in Computer Science, and contains information relevant to students
pursuing them. If you are pursuing a Masters degree, please refer to
the Graduate Handbook instead of this document
(\shrunkurl{gradhandbook}).

In order to minimize duplicated information, this document references
other documents rather than copying their content. The PDF version of
this Handbook presents these references as clickable links.

Some aspects of our programs are complex, and you may find it
difficult to choose among alternatives. In those cases, we present our
suggested default choice as a tip, as shown below. You are not
required to follow these tips, but doing so is often a prudent choice.
\index{tips}
\begin{tip}
When in doubt, heed tips such as this one.
\end{tip}

This document has been formatted so that it may be printed as a
booklet. Print double-sided with staples (or other binding) on the
left side. The document will look best if printed in color, but it may
also be printed in grayscale (a.k.a. semitone).

Prior versions of this document included a \emph{Major Progress Check
  Sheet.} This is no longer included, since the \emph{Print Degree
  Planner} link on the CS B.S. page in the University Catalog
(\shrunkurl{major}) produces an equivalent checklist form.

\chapter{The CS Major}

\section{Major Requirements at a Glance}

The requirements for the CS B.S. are detailed in the University
Catalog (\shrunkurl{major}). The requirements fit into 7 categories:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Lower-Division Core:} 100/200-level CPSC courses covering
  computer programming, data structures, and hands-on software
  development practices.
\item \emph{Examination in Programming Proficiency (EPP):} This
  comprehensive exam establishes mastery of essential Lower-Division
  Core material, and must be passed before taking most Upper-Division
  Core and Elective Track courses.
  \index{examination in programming proficiency (EPP)}
\item \emph{Mathematics Requirements:} MATH courses laying the
  foundation for CS theory and practice.
\item \emph{Science and Mathematics Electives:} Physical science
  and/or mathematics courses that provide a breadth of scientific
  knowledge and prepare students for certain upper-division electives.
\item \emph{Upper-Division Core:} 300/400-level CPSC courses that
  build directly upon the Lower-Division Core, Mathematics, and
  Science courses lised above, and complete the computer science
  canon.
\item \emph{Elective Track:} You may choose whichever of the five
  tracks that meshes best with your interests and career goals.
\item \emph{General Education (GE):} A blend of varied topics that
  round out a broad, liberal arts education, and satisfy University
  graduation requirements.
\end{enumerate}
  
Our accreditor, ABET\index{ABET}, requires at least 30 units of
mathematics and science courses. The Mathematics Requirements and
Science and Mathematics Electives together satisfy this 30-unit
requirement.

\section{Major Prerequisite Tree}
\label{section:major_prerequisite_tree}

The following tree graph diagram illustrates the prerequisite and
corequisite relationships between courses required for the major.

\MajorTree

\begin{tip} \index{unit limit}
  You are ordinarily limited to 16 units each term. In order to finish
  the B.S. program in 8 semesters, you will need to take five classes
  each semester. Almost all CPSC and GE courses are 3 units each;
  almost all mathematics and science courses are 4 units each. Plan on
  taking four 3-unit courses (CPSC and/or GE), and one 4-unit course
  (mathematics or science) each semester, for a total of 16 units,
  until you have completed all required 4-unit courses.
\end{tip}

\section{Lower-Division Core}
The first three courses in the major are CPSC 120, 121, and 131. These
courses must be taken in sequence, and are prerequisites to
practically every other CS course.

\begin{tip}
  Prioritize completing CPSC 120, 121, then 131 as soon as possible.
\end{tip}

If you come to CSUF with prior programming expertise, you may be able
to skip some of these courses. See sections \ref{section:placement}
and \ref{section:ap} for more information.

Our introductory programming courses are taught in C++, but cover
concepts that are common to practically all programming languages. To
establish some breadth of programming fluency, you are required to
learn a second programming language. This is accomplished by passing
one of the CPSC 223 courses.

\begin{tip}
Choose \emph{CPSC 223C - C Programming} if you plan on taking
security-related courses later on.
\end{tip}

%\begin{tip}
%Choose \emph{CPSC 223J - Java Programming} if you plan on taking web-related courses later on. Definitely take 223J if you plan on following the \IeTrackName~track\IeTrackIndex.
%\end{tip}

\begin{tip}
  Python is used in many upper-division courses, so unless you are on
  one of the two specific paths above, take \emph{CPSC 223P - Python
    Programming}.
\end{tip}

Students enrolled in CSPC 120, CPSC 121, and CPSC 131 are recommended
to use the Computer Science Department’s official GNU/Linux
development environment, Tuffix. Tuffix is Tuffy the Titan’s Linux
distribution.

Instructions on how to install Tuffix or a Tuffix based VM are online
at \shrunkurl{tuffixinstall}. The Tuffix Titanium Community for
Students,
\url{https://communities.fullerton.edu/course/view.php?id=1547} is the
best venue to receive help with Tuffix.

Students may self-enroll in the community; first login to your portal,
then navigate to \emph{Titanium communities}, next under the dashboard
to the left – click \emph{Site home}, then click \emph{Search Courses}
on the right, search for ‘Tuffix’, in the results click \emph{Tuffix
  Students}, under the gear in the upper right select \emph{Enrol me
  in this course}, finally click on the button \emph{Enrol me}. You
may unenroll at any time.

The Tuffix home page is \url{https://github.com/kevinwortman/tuffix}.

Students interested in using Microsoft development tools may request a
Dreamspark account at \url{http://dsreqform.ecs.fullerton.edu/}. A
student may, at no monetary cost, download full featured versions of
Microsoft Visual Studio.

Students interested in using Apple development tools can freely
download Xcode through the App Store application bundled with
macOS. Students may download Xcode directly from
\url{https://developer.apple.com/xcode/}.

A CentOS-based shell server is available through secure shell (ssh)
and secure file transfer protocol (sftp). The hostname is
ecs.fullerton.edu. If your email address is malcolm@csu.fullerton.edu,
then your username is malcolm. If you are using a command-line ssh
client, then your command to connect to ecs.fullerton.edu will be `ssh
malcolm@ecs.fullerton.edu`.


%The Lower Division Core includes \emph{CPSC 254 - Software
%Development with Open Source Systems,} which carries 3 units. You may
%not use \emph{CPSC 253U - Workshop in UNIX} in lieu of 254. Only CPSC
%254 counts toward the CS major. 253U is intended only for Computer
%Engineering majors and carries only 1 unit.

\section{Examination in Programming Proficiency (EPP)}
\index{examination in programming proficiency (EPP)} You must pass the
Examination in Programming Proficiency (EPP) before taking most of the
300/400-level Computer Science courses. This examination determines
whether you have the basic programming skills needed to succeed in
upper division courses. It focuses on the concepts and skills covered
in CPSC 121 and CPSC 131.

\begin{tip}
  Take the EPP as soon as possible after completing CPSC 131.
\end{tip}

The EPP is given as part of \emph{CPSC 301 - Programming Lab
  Practicum.} You must register in CPSC 301 and attend the first two
weeks of the course. After an orientation meeting at the first class
meeting, you will take a two-part exam during the second and third
class meetings. You will be notified at the fourth meeting whether you
have passed or not. If you pass, you may drop the course before the
end of the second week of classes. You are responsible for dropping
the class; you will not be automatically dropped if you pass the
exam. If you do not pass, you must continue in CPSC 301 and work on
your programming skills. Passing CPSC 301 is equivalent to passing the
Examination in Programming Proficiency.

The EPP is a prerequisite for several 300-level core courses as shown
in the prerequisite tree in Section
\ref{section:major_prerequisite_tree}. These courses are in turn
prerequisites for other 300/400-level courses. The EPP is a
prerequisite for the remaining 400-level courses that aren’t in this
thread, except for \emph{CPSC 440 - Computer System Architecture.}
There are very few upper-division courses that you can take without
first passing the EPP or CPSC 301. You should consult the Department
Office for advisement.

More information about the EPP is available online at \shrunkurl{epp}.

To help improve your ability to pass the EPP please spend time every
week dedicated to problem solving and programming. Students are
recommended to work through problems given in previous homework
assignments and looking for good problem sets online such as Project
Euler, \url{https://projecteuler.net/}.

\section{Mathematics Requirements}

Before enrolling in Math 150A, you must either have recently passed
\emph{MATH 125 - Precalculus,} an equivalent course at another
institution, or passed the Mathematics Qualifying Exam. Additional
information on this exam is available in the online registration
guide, and from the Fullerton Testing Center, University Hall 229, and
(657) 278-3838.

\section{Science and Mathematics Electives}

As stated in the University Catalog (\shrunkurl{sciencemath}), you
must complete at least 12 units of natural science and/or mathematics
courses chosen from a designated list. The list includes only courses
that dovetail with CS material, and may fit within a coherent 12-unit
curriculum. Due to GE and ABET requirements, you must take at least
one course with a laboratory experience. Eligible laboratory courses
are designated in the Catalog.

Choose a set of courses that support each other and your future
studies. Plan ahead, and discuss your plan for this requirement with
your adviser.

\begin{tip}
PHYS 225, 225L, 226, 226L, and MATH 250A provide a strong foundation
for later CS courses, meet all Science and Mathematics requirements,
and fit within 12 units. Take this set of electives unless you are
working toward a specific study plan focusing on biology, chemistry,
geology, or mathematics.
\end{tip}

%MATH 250A and MATH 250B may not be counted toward both the Scientific
%Computing Track \ScTrackIndex and Science and Mathematics
%Electives. Students who apply these courses toward Science and
%Mathematics Electives may substitute adviser-approved 400-level CPSC
%courses to meet the 15-unit requirement of the Scientific Computing
%Track.

%\begin{tip} If you are working toward the Scientific Computing Track,
%complete this requirement with MATH 250A, MATH 250B, PHYS 225, and
%PHYS 225L. This will give you substantial flexibility in choosing
%electives to finish the track, and help you complete prerequisite
%courses rapidly.  \end{tip}

The two-semester biology sequence is BIOL 151 and BIOL 152. This
sequence replaced older courses numbered BIOL 171 and 172. Current
students should take 151 and 152, but you may see references to 171
and 172 in some documents. Students who took 171 and 172 while they
were offered may count those courses toward the Science and
Mathematics Electives requirement.

\section{Upper Division Core}

The University requires that every bachelor degree candidate take an
upper division writing course. \emph{CPSC 311 - Technical Writing for
  Computer Science} meets the writing course requirement. This course
must be passed with a minimum grade of C (2.0) or better.

\emph{CPSC 481 - Artificial Intelligence} is the Core course with the
longest chain of prerequisites. Plan your schedule so that you make
steady progress toward meeting 481's prerequisites.

\begin{tip}
  If possible, make progress on each of the following prerequisite
  chains every semester:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item CPSC 120, 121, 131, EPP/301, 335, 481
  \item MATH 270A, 270B
  \item MATH 150A, 150B, 338
  \end{enumerate}
\end{tip}

\section{Computer Science Electives}
\label{section:cs_electives}
\index{CS electives}
\index{electives}
You must select 6 elective courses to satisfy your degree
requirements. Select elective courses that are best aligned to your
personal objectives. For example, if you aspire to create web
applications and mobile apps, then courses such as CPSC 353, CPSC 411,
CPSC 349 and CPSC 476 are excellent choices. Consult mentors and
advisors in selecting the elective courses that match your goals.

Courses outside of the computer science department may be used as
elective courses. You must seek approval from a major advisor before
taking the course.

\subsection{Upper Division CS Electives}
\label{section:lower_division_cs_electives}
\index{lower division CS electives}
\index{electives}
You may complete at most 3.0 units of Lower Division CS Electives.

Students that are need additional units due to the Placement
Examination, transfer, or other circumstances are encouraged to
consult with a major advisor and select upper division CS Electives.
\begin{itemize}
\item CPSC 254 - Software Development with Open Source Systems
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Upper Division CS Electives}
\label{section:upper_division_cs_electives}
\index{upper division CS electives}
\index{electives}

Your are require you to complete at least 15.0 units of Upper Division
CS Electives. You may need to take additional electives if you are
short on units due to the Placement Examination, transfer, or other
circumstances.

A course may be used as an Upper Division CS Elective if it is a
3-unit, upper-division, CPSC course that is not an Upper Division Core
requirement. Therefore, the following courses may count as Upper
Division CS Electives:
\begin{itemize}
% \item CPSC 303 - Multimedia Concepts (3) % slated for deletion

\item CPSC 495 - Internship in Computer Science (3)
\item CPSC 499 - Independent Study (3)
\end{itemize}

You may be able to use an adviser-approved course not on this list as
an Upper Division CS Elective. Such a course must be at least 3 units
and directly related to your academic goals. If this interests you,
discuss it with a major adviser. You may need to file a request
form;\index{request form} see Section \ref{section:request_forms}.

\section{General Education (GE)}

% This link is used multiple times so we define a macro for inserting it.
\newcommand{\gecourselist}{\emph{How do I find which courses are approved for GE?} (\shrunkurl{gecourses})}

The Undergraduate Studies \& General Education website
(\shrunkurl{ge}) describes University GE\index{general education}
requirements in detail. The list of all GE-approved courses is on the
\gecourselist page.

Prior to Fall 2018 \CampusName~students are ordinarily required to
take at least 51 units and 19 categories of GE courses. CS majors meet
some of these requirements through their required courses, and some
requirements are waived for CS majors.

Beginning in Fall 2018, \CampusName~students are ordinarily required
to take at least 48 units and 18 categories of GE courses. CS majors
meet some of these requirements through their required courses, and
some requirements are waived for CS majors.

\begin{table}

This leaves 27 units and 10 categories which must be satisfied by
additional courses.

In addition, \CampusName~students are required to take at least 6
units of GE at the upper-division (300/400) level. 4 of these are
satisfied by MATH 338, so at least 2 of your additional GE units must
be upper-division.

The following two table lists the remaining GE categories, and a
suggested course for each category.

% http://catalog.fullerton.edu/content.php?catoid=17&navoid=2054
\subsection{Grades}
\label{subsection:grades}
A repeatable grade is a ``D'', ``F'', or ``W'' grade. Students may
repeat courses for which a ``C-'' or lower grades were earned at CSUF
or other institutions. When repeating a course, the tradition grading
system (``A'', ``B'', ``C'', etc.) shall be used (i.e. ``CR''/``NC''
is not an option). In computing the grade-point average, only the most
recently earned grades and grad epoints shall be used for the first 16
units of repeated. This is called grade forgiveness yet the original
grade shall remain on your academic record.

In the case of any repetition beyond the 16-unit limit or in courses
for which a C or better grade was awarded, both grades are considered
in computing grade-point averages. Students may be permitted to repeat
an additional 12 units in addition to the 16 units for which grade
forgiveness is permitted. This process is by petition through
Admissions \& Records and you must seek the support of an academic
advisor and the department chair. The repeat grade shall not replace
the original grade. Both grades shall be calculated in the student’s
overall grade-point average.

Students earning a grade of ``D-'' (grade-point 0.7) or better have
earned a passing grade and will earn the units towards their
degree. Students must have a grade-point average of 2.0 or greater to
earn a degree.

Students are strongly advised to repeat courses that lay the
foundation for their education such as their lower- and upper-division
core courses. In circumstances were a student earns a grade between
``D-'' and ``C+'' due to poor health, difficulties outside of the
classroom, or other circumstances that impacted the student's ability
to succeed, the student is strongly recommended to meet with an
academic advisor and determine in consultation with the advisor if not
repeating the class is in the student's best interest.


\chapter{The CS Minor}

There is strong demand for expertise in programming, data
representation, and computational principles. The rise of e-commerce,
electronic music, digital humanities, and other interdisciplinary
fields shows that a CS Minor can complement any field of study.

To select Computer Science as your minor, visit the CS office and fill
out a Request for Minor Objective form.

\section{Minor Requirements at a Glance}
The requirements for the CS minor are detailed in the University
Catalog (\shrunkurl{minor}). You are required to complete the
following courses:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The same three-course programming sequence (CPSC 120, 121, and
    131) as CS majors.
  \item CPSC 313, which satisfies GE B.5.
  \item One Minor Elective: an adviser-approved 3-unit 300/400-level
    CS course. Advisors will not approve CPCS 311 (Upper Division
    Writing Requirement), CPSC 313 (G.E. Course), and CPSC 315 (CS
    Majors Professional Ethics Course) towards this requirement.
\end{enumerate}

You may have to take additional courses to meet the prerequisites for
your CS courses. The upper-division courses that are available to
students after successfully completing CPSC 131 are CPSC 332, CPSC
351, and CPSC 386. Upper division courses that you can take after
taking and passing the EPP are CPSC 323 and CPSC 411. If a student
completes MATH 270B or MATH 280, CPSC 439 is an option.

Computer Engineering majors may count one lower division course
towards the CS minor. In other words, one of the CPSC 120, CPC 121, or
CPSC 131 courses count towards the CS minor. Computer Engineerings
majors must take additional 200-level, 300-level, or 400-level courses
to satisfy the minor's requirements.

At least 6 units must be upper division (300/400 level) and completed
at \CampusName. At least 12 units, including the minimum 6 units of
upper division course work, must be courses that are not being used to
fulfill requirements for your major.

\section{Minor Prerequisite Tree}

\MinorTree

\section{Suggested Minor Electives}

There are many 300/400-level CS courses to choose from, but most of
them have significant prerequisites, which may be an obstacle.

The following courses may be used as Minor Electives, and have no
prerequisites aside from CPSC 120, 121, and 131:
\begin{enumerate}
\item CPSC 332 - File Structures and Database Systems (3)
\item CPSC 386 - Introduction to Game Design and Production (3)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Academic Requirements}

You must earn a ``C-'' or higher in order to count a course toward the
CS minor.

\section{For Majors in Related Fields}

As stated above, at least 12 units, including the minimum 6 units of
upper division course work, must be courses that are not being used to
fulfill requirements for your major. This has implications on students
whose major includes some CPSC courses.

\subsubsection{Computer Engineering Major and Computer Science Minor}

The Computer Engineering major includes CPSC 120, 121, 131, 253U, and
351, so none of these count toward the 12-unit requirement. CPSC 313,
and the 3-unit elective (other than 351), provide 6 units distinct
from the Computer Engineering major, leaving 6 units remaining. So a
Computer Engineering major must complete 6 more units specifically for
the CS minor.

\subsubsection{Electrical Engineering Major and Computer Science minor}

The Electrical Engineering major includes CPSC 120, so CPSC 120 does
not count toward the 12-unit requirement. The remaining Minor courses
(CPSC 121, 131, 313, and the Minor Elective) together satisfy the
12-unit requirement, as long as none of them are being used as
Electrical Engineering electives.

\subsubsection{Information Systems and Decision Sciences and Computer Science Double Majors}

The Information Systems and Decision Sciences major includes ISDS 309,
which is not equivalent to any CPSC course.
 
\chapter{Alternative Pathways}

\section{Transfer}
\index{transfer}

If you're a transfer student from a California Community College, you
should refer to \url{assist.org}. A department adviser can help you
with these equivalencies and give the required approval.

Transfer courses cannot be applied toward the major or accepted as
prerequisites until they are recorded in the Titan Degree Audit (TDA)
system. You should have your official transcripts sent to the office
of Admissions and Records; see \shrunkurl{admissions} for more
information.

To find articulation agreements in the \url{assist.org} database,
start by loading the web page \url{http://www.assist.org}, as shown
below.

\newcommand{\AssistOrgScreenshot}[1]{
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/assist-#1.png}
  \end{center}
}

\AssistOrgScreenshot{1}

Select the institution you'd like to transfer \emph{from;} in this
example we will use Irvine Valley College (IVC).

\AssistOrgScreenshot{2}

Then indicate that you are transferring \emph{to}~\CampusName.

\AssistOrgScreenshot{3}

Finally, indicate that you are interested in courses relevant to the
Computer Science major.

\AssistOrgScreenshot{4}

The text within the scroll bars shows established articulations
between CSUF and IVC. For instance, CSUF CPSC 120 is equivalent to IVC
CS 36.

\AssistOrgScreenshot{5}

If you explore the page, you will see that IVC offers equivalents for
almost all of the required lower-division CS courses. IVC CS 36, 37,
41, 38, 40A, and 40B articulate to CPSC 120, 121, 131, 223J, and 240,
which are all Lower-Division Core courses except CPSC 254. IVC MATH
3A, 3B, 30, and 31 articulate to CSUF MATH 150A, 150B, 270A, and 270B,
which are all Mathematics Requirements except MATH 338. IVC PHYS 4A,
PHYS 4B, and MATH 4A articulate to CSUF PHYS 225, 225L, 226, 226L, and
MATH 250A, which together satisfy the Science and Mathematics
Electives requirement.

\section{Computer Science Placement Examination}
\label{section:placement}
\index{placement examination} Our courses CPSC 120 and CPSC 121 cover
computer programming. If you are proficient in this material, but do
not have academic credit, you may attempt to establish your
proficiency and skip one or both courses by taking the Computer
Science Placement Examination. If you have taken CPSC 120, 121, or 131
at \CampusName, you are not eligible to take the Placement
Examination. See the major's description in the University Catalog
(\shrunkurl{major}) for more information.

The date, time, and location of Placement Examinations are given in
the Department Placement Exams section of the Registration Guide for
the current term. You can find Registration Guides at
\shrunkurl{registration}.

\section{Missing CPSC 120 or 121}

If you bypass CPSC 120 by passing the Computer Science Placement
Examination, you will be short 3 units in the Lower Division Core
major requirement. Likewise, if you bypass both CPSC 120 and 121, you
will be short 6 units. Some uncommon transfer situations can also
cause you to be short on units, for instance if you transfer from a
school on the quarter system.

If you are short on Lower Division Core units, you will need to earn
substitute units by taking extra units of CPSC 223 and/or Upper
Division CS Electives (listed in Section
\ref{section:upper_division_cs_electives}).


\section{Advanced Placement (AP)}
\label{section:ap}
\index{advanced placement (AP)} If you took the Computer Science AP
exam and scored well, you may be able to get credit for CPSC 120, or
both 120 and 121. See the Credit by Advanced Placement Chart
(\shrunkurl{ap}) in the University Catalog.

\section{Internships}

Learning takes place in many settings, not just the classroom. When
you complete your educational career and are entering the professional
job market for the first time, extensive professional experience can
be highly beneficial. For this reason, the University and the Computer
Science Department maintain an active internship program as a service
to all students interested in obtaining employment while still in
school.

Academic internships bear credit at \CampusName. Students enroll in an
internship course and complete course requirements. The number of
units you receive depends on the number of hours you complete at your
internship site.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
  \textbf{Hours at Internship Site} & \textbf{Units} \\ \hline
  40--60 hours & 1 unit \\ \hline
  80--100 hours & 2 units \\ \hline
  120--150 hours & 3 units \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

An academic internship is a work-learning partnership between a
student, the university, and a host company or organization that bears
a direct relationship to a student’s major and professional goals.

EGGN 495 is a ``supervision only'' class. There are no class
meetings. Students will receive a letter grade at the end of the
semester based on their performance in the internship project. As far
as the coursework is concerned, all that is required is that students
complete the internship with the company and submit a final report by
the end of the semester. The company name and the project supervisor's
name must be included in the report. The report does not have to be
approved/signed by the company. Students should address the following
items in the report:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Details of the project.
\item Tasks the student was primarily responsible for.
\item What the student learned from the project he/she completed.
\item How the project benefited the student from an academic standpoint.
\end{enumerate}

Benefits of the internship program in Computer Science include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Industrial work experience.
\item Job placement assistance from the Center for Internships \& Community Engagement (CICE) (\shrunkurl{cice}).
\item Up to 3 units of credit.
\end{itemize}

We recommend that you consider an internship when you reach junior or senior status.

To register for an internship, follow the instructions at CICE's website (\shrunkurl{cice}).

\section{International Students}

International students must obtain a \emph{CPT I-20} form from the
International Education and Exchange office in UH-244. Check with IEE
for admissible dates prior to completing the CICE Registration.

\section{ROTC}

Computer Science majors intersted in joining the Reserve Officers' Training
Corps (ROTC) program should schedule a long appointment (30 minutes) with an
advisor in their freshman year to map out the complete study plan.  Prior to
the meeting, the student must obtain the proper documents from ROTC office
located in MS-101 (Military Science Building room 101) and bring those
documents with them to the advising session.

\section{Independent Study}

You may take CPSC 499 Independent Study as an Upper Division CS
Elective. This course allows you to pursue a topic that is not covered
by any regular course, under the supervision of a faculty advisor.

All independent study applications must be approved by the study's
faculty advisor and department chair by the end of the semester prior
to the proposal’s start date. That means independent study proposals
for the Fall are due in by the end of the previous Spring semester and
proposals for the Spring are due in the previous Fall semester.

You must submit an Independent Study Application to the department
office, which will supply the form. As stated on the form, the
Application must be accompanied by a study plan which includes the
study's objective(s), the study's outcome(s), a 16 week study plan,
the basis for evaluation, and the date(s) that student work is due. A
template is available at \shrunkurl{isplan}.

You may take up to three units per semester, and apply a maximum of
three units towards the degree. The University allows a maximum of
nine units, but the Computer Science Department allows only three
units.

You will not be able to register for this course until the Department
grants you permission to do so. You should contact the Department to
verify that this has been done.

\section{Petitioning for Classes}

When a class is closed because all the seats in the class are full, a
student may petition to add the course once the semester begins. This
is where a student attends the class and places his or her name on the
paper waiting list that the instructor passes out in class.

The Titan Online waiting lists, also called the \emph{electronic
  waiting lists,} have no impact on the petitioning process and the
Department's paper waiting lists.

The paper waiting lists are returned to the CS Department Office and
the Department attempts to enroll as many students as possible, giving
priority to those closest to graduation. This process does not
guarantee enrolling in the desired course.

Students are encouraged to attend as many classes as possible to
maximize the number of waiting lists their name appears on. This
signals to the Department office that you are able to attend the
course. The use of proxies (asking friends to attend the class for
you) is prohibited and is considered an act of academic dishonesty.

\section{Request Forms}
\label{section:request_forms}
\index{request form}

The TDA\index{TDA} software system usually does a good job of automatically
tracking your completion of major and minor
requirements. Unfortunately, though, it may mishandle exceptional
circumstances, such as a transfer from a university on the quarter
system. If your TDA is inaccurate, you need to ask the Department to
correct your TDA manually.

There are four forms that you can use to request that the Department
adjust your TDA.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Use the \emph{Domestic Course Articulation Request} to ask the
    Department whether courses from another college or university in
    the United States can count toward Computer Science major or minor
    requirements.
  \item Use the \emph{International Course Articulation Request} to
    ask whether courses from a college or university in a different
    country can count toward Computer Science major or minor
    requirements.
  \item Use the \emph{Undergraduate Course Reallocation Request} form
    to ask the Department to reallocate a course that appears on your
    TDA which does not appear in the correct category. This may happen
    if you have taken an advisor-approved elective which was not
    automatically recognized by the TDA software, you have changed
    catalog years, or courses transferred from another institution
    appear uncatagorized or the incorrect category.  Another common
    case is when you take a course that was created after your catalog
    year. For example, CS 223C and the cybersecurity courses are new
    courses that do not appear on the 2007 or 2011 TDAs. Use
    \emph{Undergraduate Course Reallocation Request} to count these
    courses towards your degree.
\end{enumerate}

Blank forms are available at \shrunkurl{forms}, or as hard-copies in
the Department office. To file a request, submit a completed hard-copy
form to the Department office. The request will typically be processed
within ten business days. The outcome of the request will be
communicated to the applicant through an Advising Note in the
applicant’s TDA. The Department Chair or designee has sole discretion
to approve or deny these requests and those decisions are final and
non-negotiable.

\chapter{Advisement}

It can be frustrating to find out that you took a class that wasn't
useful for your course of study. Not being able to take a class when
you want because of a needed prerequisite is even worse---it slows
your progress and can delay your graduation. To avoid problems like
these, the University offers advisement counseling to all
students. This is your opportunity to review your progress toward your
degree and to discuss electives that match your career goals.

Developing the skills in identifying and connecting with formal and
informal advisors and mentors is a skill that students need to
develop. Set a goal for yourself to find mentors who will support you
and keep you motivated on your path through the university.

\section{General Advice}
\index{advisement!general} Any student who wishes to discuss any
concern may contact the assistant deans of the college. Assistant
deans are student advocates who will help you navigate the
university’s policies and procedures and assist with resolving any
conflict.
\begin{itemize}
\item Assistant Dean for Student Affairs Carlos Santana, CS-206A,
  (657) 278-4407, csantana@fullerton.edu
\item Assistant Dean International Programs and Global Engagement

\section{Major Advisement}
\index{advisement!major} Students may seek major advising from major
advisors in the computer science department and through the ECS
Student Success Center.

The Student Success Center on the second floor of the Computer Science
Building can answer many of your questions regarding General Education
as well. They are located in room CS 201. Their phone number is
657-278-3879. Their web site is
https://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/resources/StudentSuccessCenter.php

Computer Science department advisors are members of the faculty and
you may schedule an appointment to see one by contacting the
department office. The contact information for the department is in
Section~\ref{section:the_department}.

\section{Required Advisement}
\index{advisement!required} The College of Engineering and Computer
Science places a registration hold on all undergraduate students once
a year to ensure the student meets with a department advisor. You will
not be able to register for any courses until you consult with a
department advisor and the hold is subsequently removed.

Students who are in good academic standing and have the last two
digits of their CWID ending in an odd number are required to complete
mandatory advisement in the fall term. Students in good academic
standing and have the last two digits of their CWID ending in an even
number are required to complete mandatory advisement during the spring
term.

Freshmen and sophomore students must see an advisor in the ECS Student
Success Center to lift the registration hold. Junior and senior
students must see one of the department's major advisors to lift the
registration hold.

Probation students are required to complete mandatory advisement every
semester regardless of odd/even CWIDS.

\section{General Education (GE) Advisement}
\index{GE} \index{general education}
The University encourages all students to seek GE advisement, each
semester, well in advance of registration.  You may obtain information
about the \CampusName~GE curriculum and degree requirements by
visiting the Academic Advisement Center in UH-123B.

\section{First-time Freshmen}
\index{freshmen}

\section{Transfer Students}
\index{transfer}
You should make an advisement appointment as early as possible. The
department adviser can answer your questions about transfer credit for
general education courses and can evaluate courses that apply to your
major. Please bring any transcripts or grade reports you have,
official or not, to this appointment. A catalog from your prior
institution may be useful, particularly from those outside the Orange
County area.

\section{Nearing Graduation (Within One Year)}
\index{graduation}
After completing 90 units of coursework, you are eligible to apply for
graduation. The only way to apply for graduation is online through the
TITAN Online Student Center. You cannot graduate without a completed
Grad Check. \index{grad check} The University Catalog has more
information on Grad Checks (\shrunkurl{gradcheck}).

\section{Probation}
\index{probation}
If you are on probation, it is definitely time to see an
adviser. Until you do so, a hold will be in place on your file,
preventing you from registering in classes. Your adviser will discuss
with you the problems that led to your probation and review strategies
you should take to get off probation. Make your advisement appointment
early so your registration is not held up.

\section{Peer Advising \& Clubs}
\index{peer advising}
There are lots of student clubs on this campus for all sorts of
interests. Visit http://www.fullerton.edu/sll/involvement/clubs/ and
look at the different clubs that are at CSU Fullerton. You start your
own club if you don't see a club that aligns to your interests.

Some clubs that are computer science clubs are ACM, ACM-W, OSS,
Machine Learning club.
