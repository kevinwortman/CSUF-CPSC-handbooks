\chapter{Introduction}

\section{The field of computer science}
Computer Science is the systematic study of computing systems and computation. The body of knowledge contains the theoretical foundation for understanding computing systems and methods, design methodology, algorithms, and software and hardware tools.

These programs cover a wide range of areas, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item multimedia and digital game technologies,
\item Internet and enterprise computing,
\item wireless and mobile computing,
\item databases and data mining,
\item computer security,
\item software engineering, and
\item computational bioinformatics.
\end{itemize}

Computer Science prepares graduates for rewarding careers in all areas of business, government, education and industry. These organizations, large and small, need computer professionals to address their needs with specific programs and systems. Computer science professionals tackle complicated problems and create computer solutions to solve them, devising new ways to use computers.

\chapter{Advisement}

It can be frustrating to find out that you took a class that wasn’t useful for your course of study. Not being able to take a class when you want because of a needed prerequisite is even worse---it slows your progress and can delay your graduation. To avoid problems like these, the University offers advisement counseling to all students. This is your opportunity to review your progress toward your degree and to discuss electives that match your career goals.

\section{Major Advisement}
\index{advisement!major}
You have to set up an advisement appointment yourself. Contact the department and ask for an advisement appointment. Our contact information is in section \ref{section:the_department}

\section{Required Advisement}
\index{advisement!required}
The College of Engineering and Computer Science places a registration hold on all undergraduate students once a year to ensure the student meets with a department advisor. Students whose surname begins with ``A'' thru ``M'' will have a hold each Fall term. Those whose surnname begins with ``N'' thru ``Z'' will find a registration hold each Spring term.  You will not be able to register for any courses until you consult with a department advisor and the hold is subsequently removed.

\section{General Education (GE) Advisement}
\index{advisement!GE} \index{general education}
The University encourages all students to seek GE advisement, each semester, well in advance of registration.  You may obtain information about the Cal State Fullerton GE curriculum and degree requirements by visiting the Academic Advisement Center in UH-123B.

\section{First-time freshmen}
\index{freshmen}
You should make an appointment to see the department adviser as early as possible. It’s very important that you understand the program and the sequence in which you should take courses.

\section{Transfer students}
\index{transfer}
You should make an advisement appointment as early as possible. The department adviser can answer your questions about transfer credit for general education courses and can evaluate courses that apply to your major. Please bring any transcripts or grade reports you have, official or not, to this appointment. A catalog from your prior institution may prove useful, particularly from those outside the Orange County area.

\section{Nearing graduation (within one year)}
\index{graduation}
After completing 90 units of coursework, you are eligible to apply for graduation. The only way to apply for graduation is online through the TITAN Online Student Center. You cannot graduate without a completed Grad Check. \index{grad check} The University Catalog \href{http://catalog.fullerton.edu/content.php?catoid=2&navoid=108#Graduation_Requirement_Check}{has more information on Grad Checks}.

\section{Probation}
\index{probation}
If you are on probation, it is definitely time to see an adviser. Until you do so, a hold will be in place on your file, preventing you from registering in classes. Your adviser will discuss with you the problems that led to your probation and review strategies you should take to get off probation. Make your advisement appointment early so your registration is not held up.

\section{Your Catalog Year}
\index{catalog year}
Be sure to follow the course requirements for your catalog year. Your catalog year is determined by the Admissions Office and is a part of your student records. Typically, this is the year you began college; occasionally an adviser may approve a later year.
